            <p>Perudo is a dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always challenge the last bid. When that happens, all dice are revealed and either the bidder or the challenger loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.</p>
